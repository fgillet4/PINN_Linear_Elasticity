put focus on the loss function

experimented with weighing the terms in different ways.


Extra Challenge

Train it here and create some other problem w different problem w diff geometry and see if it generalizes. MAterial parameters as input and do a bunch of different data points with actualy parameters knows. The parameters as a 

Add plasticity
recurrent model that has hidden variable that takes care of the plastic accumulated strain 

Create some different geometry, run some finite elements, phyics loss and data loss part. You have your model and some stress strain curve. 

Abba
surrogate model that you train up. 


Hyper parameters 
OPtimizer what u use
Adam everyone knows its always okay, there are other that are better requires 
Do more iterations

lasso and ridge, alot is built 

Adam, has labda weight decay. Lasso 2. IT only changeds the weights it checks the gradients, it checks the size of the weights. Your loss function will change.

L2 regularization, called weight decay is somethign we can addd gto the loss function. Can make convergence harder. Might be more robust compare lasso and ridge. 

learn rate scheduling. Learn rate. grad(loss fn) weights will
w = w -alpha*grad(loss)

alpha is the learn rate

lr

optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr= 1e-2)

lr i slearn rate, too small learn rate might get stuck, too large

learn rate scheduling, start w large learnrate then slowly decreate it.

LRScheduler, change the learn rate, depending on the training epoch.
