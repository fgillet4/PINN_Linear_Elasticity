 Yes! Here are some amazing visualization ideas that would be mind-blowing for your PINN:

  ðŸŽ¯ Physics-Aware Visualizations

  1. "Physics Heat Map" - Show which parts of your domain (x,y space) the network is "thinking about" most at
  each epoch by tracking gradient flow back to inputs

  2. "Equation Discovery Viz" - Visualize how well the network satisfies each physics equation (PDE,
  constitutive, boundary) as colored overlays on the domain

  3. "Error Landscape Evolution" - 3D surface showing how prediction error changes across the physical domain
  over training

  ðŸŒŒ Network Architecture Innovations

  4. "Neuron Galaxy" - Each neuron as a "star" with brightness = activation strength, connections as
  gravitational fields, watch "neural galaxies" form

  5. "Frequency Decomposition" - Show what spatial frequencies each layer learns (like a 3D spectrogram of the
  network's "hearing")

  6. "Decision Boundary Morphing" - Watch how the network's decision boundaries evolve in input space (x,y) for
   each output

  ðŸ”¬ Mathematical Beauty

  7. "Weight Eigenspace Dance" - PCA/SVD of weight matrices, watch principal components dance as the network
  learns

  8. "Loss Landscape Flythrough" - Navigate through the high-dimensional loss landscape like a spaceship

  9. "Gradient Flow Rivers" - Show gradients as flowing water, watch how "gradient rivers" change course during
   training

  ðŸŽ¨ Artistic/Interactive

  10. "Neural Music" - Convert weight changes to sound frequencies, create a "symphony of learning"

  11. "Network Breathing" - Show the network "breathing" as activations pulse through layers in real-time

  12. "Time-Lapse Microscopy" - Zoom into individual neurons like biological cells, watch their "growth" and
  "connections"

  Which of these sounds most exciting to you? I can implement any of them! My favorites would be:

  - Physics Heat Map (super relevant to PINNs)
  - Neuron Galaxy (visually stunning)
  - Weight Eigenspace Dance (mathematically beautiful)

  Which one grabs your imagination? ðŸš€
